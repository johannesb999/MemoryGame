# My_final_project_johannes_biess

Ich musste ein neues Reposetory erstellen da mein Altes beim Mergen fehler hatte und es mir den Code komplett zerschossen hat.
Um meinen Entwicklungsverlauf nach zu vollziehen bitte im Rep Hausaufgaben myfinalproject öffnen da ist die komplette Historie erfasst.




Hier zu sehen ist ein einfaches Memory Game welches als Prüfungsleistung im Fach Programmiersprachen dient.
Es gab gewisse Anforderungen die ich zum teil umsetzen konnte:
